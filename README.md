# Hoogflix Landing page

A landing page front-end for my Plex server.  This is mainly a practice application for me using TypeScript.
The initial code base is from John Papa's [hottowel-angular-typescript](https://github.com/johnpapa/hottowel-angular-typescript), modified for my purposes.

I will not be focusing heavily on testing, but I will try to test the server side.

## Features

- Written with typescript
- More to come hopefully

## To-do

- Query plex instance for basic stats such as:
  - On/offline
  - Number of active users
  - Count of items in each library
- If offline show reason and message
- Link to go to plex
- Email form to request access to plex server
  - Rate limit
  - XSS protection
- Optionally
  - Admin dashboard
    - Added users
    - Pending users
    - Form stats
  - Turn into a docker application
  - Generify it so others can use it

## Installing

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:jordond/hoogflix.git`
2. Instal dependencies `npm install`
3. Compile by running `gulp build`

## Running

1. Export production environment `export ENV=production`
2. Run the server `node build/server/app.js`
  - Optionally run `ENV=production node build/server/app.js`
