# A Typescript, Angular, Webpack fullstack starter app

**Under active development, not ready for use**

A fullstack skeleton starter app for a trendy little web app.  Utilizing Typescript, ES6, Angular, and Webpack, with a nice gulp build system.  The client side relies on npm only and not bower.  It is more of a learning experience for me than anything.

## Features

- Written with typescript
- Uses ES6
- Backend & Frontend written in same workflow `Typescript -> ES6 -> Babel -> ES5`
- Entire stack is handled by webpack
- No bower, sticking to NPM
- Handy gulp tasks
- Easy configuration

## Tech
- **Backend**
  - Node (>v4)
  - Typescript
  - Babel
  - Webpack
- **Frontend**
  - Angular 1.x
  - Typescript
  - ES6
  - Webpack
  - Angular Material
- **Build System**
  - Gulp
  - Webpack
  - Babel
  - BrowserSync
  - many more...

## To-do
- I am currently scaffolding out the build system
- Add gulp scripts to the `package.json`
- **Backend**
  - ~~Redo the routes, and route loader~~
  - Implement sockets and configs for each route
  - ~~Global server config, powered by a `./config.js`~~
  - Make gulp read node port from `./config.js`
- **Frontend**
  - Add an actual front end example
  - ~~Add a template cache so templates don't have to be loaded from server~~
  - ~~Make sure sourcemaps are working~~

## Main Tasks
**Soon to be replaced by npm scripts**
- `gulp`: Display a list of all available tasks
- `gulp vet`: Run TSLint on all of the Typescript files
- `gulp dev`: Compile server and client code, then watch for changes
- `gulp serve`: Start up nodemon in debug mode, instead of using IDE debugger
- `gulp build`: Build production optimized code
- `gulp deploy`: Deploy production code to remote server `deploy.config.js` needs to be edited
- `gulp bump`: Increment the version, see below for flags

### Flags
- `-p | --env=production`: Force the building of production optimized code
- `-d | --env=development`: Force the non optimized code
- `--port=5000`: Specify the proxy port for browserSync (port node will be listening)
- `--debug || --debug-brk`: Will force `gulp dev` to start nodemon
- **Versioning**
  - `--type=pre` bump the prerelease version *.*.*-x
  - `--type=patch` or no flag will bump the patch version *.*.x
  - `--type=minor` bump the minor version *.x.*
  - `--type=major` bump the major version x.*.*
  - `--version=x.x.x | -v x.x.x` bump to a specific version and ignore other flags

## Installing

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:jordond/hoogflix.git`
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Compile by running `gulp build`

## Configuration

If you plan to use the deploy script, be sure to edit `deploy.config.js` with the information of the server.  To make changes to the folder structure change the paths in `gulp.config.js`.  BrowserSync settings can also be found in `gulp.config.js`.

## Running

A config file (see example.config.json) needs to be placed in the project root.  Or for better safety pass the path of the config file in as an argument.

`--config=path/to/config | -c path/to/config`

1. Export production environment `export ENV=production`
2. Run the server `node build/server/app.js`
  - Optionally run `ENV=production node build/server/app.js`

## Developing

### Issues

#### Sourcemaps
Since I am now using webpack to handle the backend, the below fix is no longer required.

I also have switched to using `node-inspector` instead of of VSCode's debugger has VSCode is the problem when it comes to sourcemaps, as node-inspector can handle them just fine.

~~Not only does the filename not work properly, the actual sourceroot option for `gulp-sourcemaps` doesn't work either.
It is not pointing to the correct path relative to the source, so you get `build/server/src/server/index.ts` instead of
`src/server/index.ts`.  So I have added a bit of a hacky function that will count the number of slashes in the source file, that will determine how many folders deep it is, and how many `../` are required.~~

~~I could just use a simple `return path.join(__dirname, '..', 'src/server');` but since I am running
gulp on a remote server, and using VSCode locally, it ends up pointing to the absolute location on
the remote machine not local, confusing VSCode.~~

~~**I expect this to break any time now, I am monitoring the gulp-sourcemaps [issue](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps/issues/163)**~~

#### NPM Modules
There is a current 'bug' in the way `typescript` and `gulp-babel` handle ES6 importing in regards
to npm modules.
As an example:
```javascript
import * as moment from 'moment'
```
Once transpiled by typescript and babel, the resulting `moment` is an inert object instead of a function.
Meaning that `moment().format('YYYY');` will not work, as `moment` is not a function.

The issue can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5458), and the [pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5285).  For the moment the workaround is as follows:

```javascript
import * as _moment from 'moment';
const moment = (_moment as any).default;
```
Yes it is ugly, but it works.
